# Crypto Currency forecasting using LSTM model
In this project, using Long Term Short Memory (LSTM),  a model to predict the future price of a cryptocurrency.

# Overview
As any good investor it is important to know regarding the high prices, low prices, hold and correct sell of the cryptocurrency to increase the profitability.
 * The objective of this project is to build a model to predict the future price of any cryptocurrency using any datasets of four other cryptocurrencies using LSTM model.
 * For this project, I have approached by taking correlation between the prices of cryptocurrencies to find the best fit to use dataset. This project holds a way to collect datasets from any finance website and modify or train them accordingly to predict the future prices.  
 * This repository holds a set of code, that can be used to collect, prepare, and train the prices of cryptocurrencies.

# Summary of Workdone

* Data:
   * The datasets used in this repository are collected online using WebReader library of pandas. The main four datasets are the dataframes of particular cyrptocurrency, for example: Bitcoin : Date, CLosing price, Opening Price, Volume of the day, and Adj closing price of the day.
   * Four datasets of Cryptocurrency, From start date- End date, (Number of days X 5 columns)
   * Input: CSV files of timeseries and prices
   * Size of datasets: The size of datasets varies how many number of days/ years taken in consideration.
   
* Preprocessing/ Clean up:
   * For this project the closing price of all the cryptocurrencies have been collected to make a new dataframe with same date. Therefore, while collecting the datasets for different cryptocurrencies having same start and end date is necessary for further steps.

* Data Visualization:
